# Flight Delays Predictions using PySpark

## Overview

This repository contains a PySpark-based machine learning model for predicting flight delays using the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Flight Delays dataset. The dataset provides comprehensive information about flights, airports, carriers, and delays in the United States.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=airports.csv). It includes multiple CSV files, such as `flights.csv`, `airports.csv`, and others, each containing valuable information for training and evaluating the predictive model.

### Downloading the Dataset

To replicate or extend the analysis, you can download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided above.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed to run the PySpark script:

- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
- [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/install.html)
